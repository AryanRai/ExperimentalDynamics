Your theoretical derivation for the reciprocating piston system with a flywheel extension is well-structured and aligns with the AMME2500 Major Assignment requirements. Below, I’ll confirm the correctness of the revised equations, address any remaining issues, and provide guidance on integrating this into your computational analysis, report, and Prospectus submission, building on the roadmap and your provided LaTeX document. I’ll also incorporate the Python code snippet you provided and suggest refinements to ensure the project meets the assignment’s expectations for novelty, dynamics principles, and clear presentation.

### Review of Revised Theoretical Derivation

#### 1. Piston Kinematics
**Displacement**:
\[
y_3(\theta) = r \cos\theta + \sqrt{l^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta}
\]
- **Correctness**: Accurate for the slider-crank mechanism, where \( r \) is the crank radius, \( l \) is the connecting rod length, and \( \theta \) is the crank angle. The reference to top-dead-center (TDC) is appropriate.
- **Comment**: The equation correctly captures the geometric relationship. Including a diagram in the report (as you plan) will clarify the coordinate system and TDC reference.

**Velocity**:
\[
\dot{y}_3 = -r \dot{\theta} \left[ \sin\theta + \frac{r \sin\theta \cos\theta}{\sqrt{l^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta}} \right]
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct. The derivation is:
  \[
  \dv{y_3}{\theta} = -r \sin\theta - \frac{r^2 \sin\theta \cos\theta}{\sqrt{l^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta}}, \quad \dot{y}_3 = \dv{y_3}{\theta} \cdot \dot{\theta}
  \]
  This matches your expression, confirming the fix from the previous erroneous \(\sqrt{2}\) term.
- **Comment**: The velocity equation is now accurate and ready for numerical implementation. Validate by checking specific cases (e.g., at \(\theta = 0\), \(\dot{y}_3 = 0\)).

**Acceleration**:
\[
\ddot{y}_3 = \left( \frac{d^2 y_3}{d\theta^2} \right) \dot{\theta}^2 + \left( \frac{dy_3}{d\theta} \right) \ddot{\theta}
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct in form, using the chain rule for acceleration.
- **Comment**: The second derivative \(\frac{d^2 y_3}{d\theta^2}\) is complex, so consider computing it numerically in Python to avoid analytical errors. For the report, note that acceleration is used for force analysis and energy calculations.

#### 2. Force and Torque Analysis
**Piston Force**:
\[
F_{\text{piston}} = F_0 \cos\theta
\]
- **Correctness**: Matches the assignment’s base system assumption of a sinusoidal pressure force.
- **Comment**: Clearly define \( F_0 \) in the report (e.g., maximum combustion pressure, in Newtons). This ties to the practical context (e.g., automotive engine).

**Torque from Piston**:
\[
\tau_{\text{piston}} = F_0 \cos\theta \cdot r \sin\theta \cdot \frac{\sqrt{l^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta}}{l}
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct, accounting for the connecting rod angle \(\phi\), where \(\sin\phi = \frac{r \sin\theta}{l}\), and \(\cos\phi = \frac{\sqrt{l^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta}}{l}\). This fixes the earlier oversimplification (\(\tau_{\text{piston}} = \frac{1}{2} F_0 r \sin(2\theta)\)).
- **Comment**: The geometric factor \(\frac{\sqrt{l^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta}}{l}\) accurately reflects the torque transmission, making the model more realistic. Validate this numerically to ensure physical consistency (e.g., torque peaks near \(\theta = 45^\circ\)).

**Damping Torque**:
\[
\tau_{\text{load}} = c \dot{\theta}
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct, aligning with the assignment’s specification that external torque is proportional to angular velocity.
- **Comment**: Using \( c \) instead of \( k \) avoids confusion with spring constants. Specify typical values (e.g., \( c = 0.2 \, \text{N·m·s} \)) in the report to ground the analysis.

#### 3. Equation of Motion with Flywheel
**Total Inertia**:
\[
I_{\text{total}} = I_c + I_f
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct, summing the crankshaft (\( I_c \)) and flywheel (\( I_f \)) moments of inertia.
- **Comment**: Include typical values (e.g., \( I_c = 0.1 \, \text{kg·m}^2 \), \( I_f = 0.5 \, \text{kg·m}^2 \)) in the report for realism.

**Equation of Motion**:
\[
(I_c + I_f) \ddot{\theta} = F_0 \cos\theta \cdot r \sin\theta \cdot \frac{\sqrt{l^2 - r^2 \sin^2\theta}}{l} - c \dot{\theta}
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct, applying Newton’s second law for rotation (\(\sum \tau = I \ddot{\theta}\)).
- **Comment**: This is the core equation for computational analysis. It accurately incorporates the flywheel’s effect on inertia, making it ideal for studying torque smoothing.

#### 4. Energy Analysis
**Flywheel Kinetic Energy**:
\[
E_{\text{flywheel}} = \frac{1}{2} I_f \dot{\theta}^2
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct, capturing the flywheel’s rotational energy.
- **Comment**: Emphasize in the report how this energy storage reduces angular velocity fluctuations, justifying the flywheel’s novelty.

**Total Kinetic Energy**:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} (I_c + I_f) \dot{\theta}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m \dot{y}_3^2
\]
- **Correctness**: Correct, including crankshaft, flywheel, and piston contributions.
- **Comment**: Justifying the omission of the connecting rod’s mass is sufficient for the base system, but consider discussing its potential impact in the report’s appendix for depth.

### Review of Python Code Snippet
Your provided Python code is a good starting point for numerical simulation. Here’s a review and suggested refinements:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

# Parameters
r = 0.05   # Crank radius (m)
l = 0.15   # Connecting rod length (m)
Ic = 0.1   # Crankshaft inertia (kg·m²)
If = 0.5   # Flywheel inertia (kg·m²)
c = 0.2    # Damping coefficient (N·m·s)
F0 = 500   # Force amplitude (N)

def system(t, y):
    theta, omega = y
    dtheta_dt = omega
    
    # Geometric term
    sin_theta = np.sin(theta)
    cos_theta = np.cos(theta)
    sqrt_term = np.sqrt(l**2 - (r**2 * sin_theta**2))
    
    # Torque from piston
    tau_piston = F0 * cos_theta * r * sin_theta * (sqrt_term / l)
    
    # Damping torque
    tau_load = c * omega
    
    # Angular acceleration
    domega_dt = (tau_piston - tau_load) / (Ic + If)
    
    return [dtheta_dt, domega_dt]

# Initial conditions: theta=0, omega=0
sol = solve_ivp(system, [0, 10], [0, 0], t_eval=np.linspace(0, 10, 1000))
```

**Strengths**:
- Correctly implements the revised equation of motion.
- Uses `solve_ivp` for numerical integration, suitable for the nonlinear ODE.
- Parameters are reasonable for a small engine.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
1. **Piston Velocity**: Add \(\dot{y}_3\) calculation for energy analysis and validation:
   ```python
   def piston_velocity(theta, omega):
       return -r * omega * (np.sin(theta) + (r * np.sin(theta) * np.cos(theta)) / np.sqrt(l**2 - r**2 * np.sin(theta)**2))
   ```
2. **Validation**: Check \(\dot{y}_3\) at \(\theta = 0\) (should be zero) and torque at \(\theta = \pi/2\) (should be near zero).
3. **Convergence Test**: Test multiple time steps (e.g., `t_eval=np.linspace(0, 10, 1000)` vs. `t_eval=np.linspace(0, 10, 10000)`) and compare \(\dot{\theta}\).
4. **Visualization**: Add plotting for \(\dot{\theta}\), \(\tau_{\text{piston}}\), and \(\dot{y}_3\):
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   t = sol.t
   theta = sol.y[0]
   omega = sol.y[1]
   tau_piston = F0 * np.cos(theta) * r * np.sin(theta) * (np.sqrt(l**2 - r**2 * np.sin(theta)**2) / l)

   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.plot(t, omega, label='Angular Velocity (rad/s)')
   plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
   plt.ylabel('Angular Velocity (rad/s)')
   plt.title('Crankshaft Angular Velocity with Flywheel')
   plt.legend()
   plt.grid()
   plt.show()

   plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
   plt.plot(t, tau_piston, label='Piston Torque (N·m)')
   plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
   plt.ylabel('Torque (N·m)')
   plt.title('Piston Torque with Flywheel')
   plt.legend()
   plt.grid()
   plt.show()
   ```
5. **Flywheel Comparison**: Run simulations with \( I_f = 0 \) (no flywheel) and varying \( I_f \) (e.g., 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 kg·m²) to quantify smoothing effects.
